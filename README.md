# Project Description

This project is part of the online course I've taken at Udemy. [https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/). Jonas Schmedtmann used PHP to build the web pages in his course. I used React to rebuild the frontend part. I also added some new features based on his UX/UI. Here is my frontend demo website: [https://natours-mh.netlify.app/](https://natours-mh.netlify.app/)
